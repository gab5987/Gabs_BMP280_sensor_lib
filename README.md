# Adafruit BMP280 Driver (Barometric Pressure Sensor)

Rewritten by Gab for personal use on a esp project.

Based on adafruit's BMP280 sensor lib. The original Adafruit's lib has a lot of unecessary, ineficient and memory demanding stuff that can be optimized for a faster/efficient run on a esp8266.
